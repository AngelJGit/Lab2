<p> One of my long-term goals in life at the moment is to successfully finish my currently enrolled program and to be able to develop a 
    strong career in this field. Therefore, 3 smaller scale goals I have are; </p>
    <ol> 
        <li> Learn the most I can about this field of work </li>
        <li> Achieve an 80% average in all my courses </li>
        <li> To make connections on my journey to graduate college </li>
        </ol>

               <p> >Hi, my name is Angel. I am 17, fresh out of highschool starting my first year in college at Humber Polytechnic, currently enrolled 
                in the Computer Porgramming and analysis
                 
                Program. I have always found an interest in coding and programming but never really pursued the study simpy becuase I was either too 
                busy, with sports, hobbies, and other interests </p>
